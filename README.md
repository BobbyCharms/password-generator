# Portfolio Mini Project 

## Description

For this project, we need to create a way for the password generator to prompt the user for inputs in order to generate a password to specifications. Though the exercise, I got to practice working with variables, functions, and conditional statements. The most challenging part of the exercise was iterating over the characters to generate the password.
